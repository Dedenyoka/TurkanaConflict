# TurkanaConflict
This project analyzes the conflicts in the Turkana region of Kenya, including the border regions shared with Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda. Currently, the code plots conflict data on a map, but future plans include deeper analysis of the data to better understand the dynamics of these conflicts.

## Features
- Visualize peace treaties.
- Visualize the top media outlets covering the conflict.
