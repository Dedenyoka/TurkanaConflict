# 📌 Turkana Conflict & Peace Agreements Analysis
## 🕊️ A data-driven exploration of conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and media coverage in the Turkana region of East Africa.
🌍 Project Overview
-The Turkana region — spanning borders between Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia — has long been affected by recurring conflicts over livestock, grazing land, and water. Despite this, it remains underrepresented in mainstream global datasets.

This project curates, cleans, and analyzes detailed event-level data on conflicts and peace agreements reported in the region from 2011 to 2025, offering a unique lens into:

- The nature of peace efforts

- The actors involved

- The effectiveness of peace interventions

 And the media coverage that amplifies (or omits) these narratives.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- (Coming soon) Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration

- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

- (Coming soon: Streamlit or Dash for interactive dashboards)

📦 Data Sources
Two curated datasets:

- Peace Agreements Dataset – 30+ events including peace accords, disarmament campaigns, and community dialogues.

- Conflict Dataset – capturing reported raids, killings, or armed clashes.

## Each row captures:

- Date and location

- Involved communities or organizations

- Event type

- Description and consequences

- Source (news outlet or organization)

🔍 Key Insights

✌️ Peace Efforts
- Most peace agreements focus on disarmament, joint grazing, and cessation of cattle raids.

- Key actors include local peace committees, community elders, and even regional militaries (e.g., UPDF).

- Some events are ceremonial (e.g., symbolic burial of weapons), while others are operational (joint patrols, disarmament drives).

 📊 Visual Analysis
- Peace event frequency over time

- Most common event types: Peace Agreements, Disarmament Initiatives, Community Meetings

- Consequences analysis: How often peace events lead to long-term cooperation?

- Media outlets: Who reports on these events most consistently?

Example Visuals:
- 📈 Bar chart: Peace events per year
- 🧭 Map : Event locations
- 📡 Pie chart: Sources of reports (e.g., local gov’t vs national media)

📰 Media Coverage Analysis
- By comparing sources across both datasets:

- Some outlets (e.g., Kenya News Agency, Turkana County Government) consistently report on peacebuilding.

- Others highlight conflict events but neglect resolutions.

- This gap in coverage can influence public and policy perception.

🚀 What's Next?
📊 Interactive Dashboard with filters by location, time, and event type.

🌐 NLP sentiment analysis on article descriptions (if full text available).

🤝 Merge with external datasets (drought, elections, aid interventions) to understand root causes.

🙋 Why This Project Matters
- Highlights underrepresented conflicts and peace efforts.

- Encourages data-informed peacebuilding strategies.

- Demonstrates technical skills in data cleaning, visualization, exploratory analysis, and critical thinking.
